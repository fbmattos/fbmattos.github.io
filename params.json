  "body": "### GREAT NEWS TO THE SWAGGER COMMUNITY!\r\nStarting January 1st 2016 the Swagger Specification has been donated to the [Open API Initiative (OAI)](https://openapis.org/) and is the foundation of the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).\r\n\r\n### A POWERFUL INTERFACE TO YOUR API\r\nSwagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API. With the largest ecosystem of API tooling on the planet, thousands of developers are supporting Swagger in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment. With a Swagger-enabled API, you get interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability.\r\n\r\nWe created Swagger to help fulfill the promise of APIs. Swagger helps companies like Apigee, Getty Images, Intuit, LivingSocial, McKesson, Microsoft, Morningstar, and PayPal build the best possible services with RESTful APIs.\r\n\r\nNow in version 2.0, Swagger is more enabling than ever. And it's 100% open source software.\r\n\r\n[VIEW SOURCE ON GITHUB](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger.io/blob/wordpress//home.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
